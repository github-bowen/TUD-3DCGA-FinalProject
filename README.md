# Project Feature Tracker

## Implemented Features

### Minimal Features

- **Multiple Viewpoints** (10/21/2024)

- **Cube Mapping (Scene Loading)** (10/22/2024)
  - Implemented WASD movement in Camera class
  - ~~TODO: Bugs after closing the window~~ (Fixed)

- **Normal mapping**

- **Environment mapping**

- **Shading**:
  - Simple shading: Lambert + Blinn-Phong;
  - Advanced shading: Textured PBR;
  - All with normal mapping.
  
- **Material textures**:
  - kd, ks, and shininess for simple shading;
  - Albedo, roughness, metallic, and ambient occlusion for PBR.
 
- **Hierarchical transformations**:
  - Animated robot arm with several components.
  - Animation is done via code (not imported from external software).

- **Bezier Curves (minimal part)**

### Extra Features (Optional)

- **Bezier Curves (extra part, moving at constant speed along a Bezier curve)**
