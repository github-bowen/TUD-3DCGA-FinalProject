## Upcoming Features

### Minimal Features

- [ ] **Advanced shading**:
  - Include complex material models (PBR shaders).
- [ ] **Material textures**:
  - Use kd (diffuse color).
  - Use ks (specular color).
  - Implement shininess and roughness parameters.
- [ ] **Normal mapping**
- [ ] **Environment mapping**
- [ ] **Smooth paths**:
  - Implement smooth paths using Bézier curves (at least 3 Cubic Bézier curves).
  - Toggle rendering of the Bézier curve on/off.
- [ ] **Hierarchical transformations**:
  - Animate an object with several components (e.g., robot arm, snake, solar system, or vehicle).
  - Ensure animation is done via code (not imported from external software).

### Extra Features (Optional)

- [ ] Move at constant speed along a Bézier curve.
- [ ] Shadows for multiple light sources.
- [ ] Shadows from environment maps.
- [ ] Particle effects (e.g., explosions, magic spells, fire).
- [ ] Procedurally generated terrains.
- [ ] Post-processing effects (e.g., glow).
- [ ] Procedurally generated water surfaces (using vertex shader).
- [ ] Animated textures with appropriate framerate.
- [ ] Changing lighting conditions (day-night system).
- [ ] Implement a minimap.
- [ ] Collision detection between player and objects.
- [ ] Procedurally generate a maze or dungeon.
- [ ] Procedurally generate environment props (buildings).
- [ ] Inverse kinematics.
- [ ] Linear Blend Skinning in shaders.
- [ ] Blend shapes in shaders.
- [ ] Screen Space Ray Tracing (SSRT) for specular reflections.
- [ ] Ambient Occlusion.
- [ ] Spatial-temporal reprojection.
